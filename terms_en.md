If, in the exceptional case that a direct debit payment arrangement is between the CLIENT and BLUEMOVE is agreed upon, under the terms that BLUEMOVE reserves the right to dictate, a document accrediting the CLIENT as the owner of the bank account to be debited is going to be required before the carsharing services by BLUEMOVE can begin.

5. The form containing the conditions of the agreement duly filled out with clear handwriting and signed will be required in the case that membership is not processed through the website. Should membership be processed through the website the filled out form filled out by the CLIENT followed by the documents sent by mail shall suffice as proof of having entered into the agreement. The CLIENT (and the USER) certifies that the documents provided to BLUEMOVE are truthful and accurate, and grants BLUEMOVE the right to independently verify them and to suspend or annul the agreement (or a particular USER's authorization) if faced by the suspicion that a document is untruthful or forged.

#### Tenth.- Insurance Excess and reduced CLIENT/USER liability.-

1 The insurance policy has an excess of one hundred and ninety five (195) euro (except for electrical vehicles in which case the excess will be of three hundred (300) euro ), or four hundred and fifty (450) euro (for all vehicles including gasoline engine vehicles) if the user's driver's license was issued less than a year before the booking was made, for any damages caused by an accident or a fire.

#### Eleventh.- Communications to be made by the CLIENT/USER to BLUEMOVE, in case of any damage, breakdowns, accidents or theft of the vehicle.-

1. In every instance where the vehicle sustains any damage or experiences some technical issues (that are not sufficient cause to immobilize the vehicle) the CLIENT/USER will have to immediately communicate these to BLUEMOVE through the assistance hotline or by sending an email to buenosdias@bluemove.es. Should this communication not be promptly undertaken, BLUEMOVE will hold the last USER to have used the vehicle after the problem is detected responsible for any damage or technical issues with it (and, ultimately, the CLIENT of which the USER is a dependant).

2. In the event of a breakdown, the CLIENT/USER must immediately communicate the problem to BLUEMOVE through the assistance hotline. BLUEMOVE will take care of solving the problem and shall send the CLIENT, where necessary, an assistance vehicle.

3. In the case of an accident: The CLIENT/USER shall make it known to BLUEMOVE through the assistance hotline as quickly as possible so that BLUEMOVE can take appropriate action and notify the insurance company. Without it affecting the previous point, the CLIENT/USER will promptly fill out the accident report (included with the vehicle's general documents) and shall send it to BLUEMOVE through the post or any other medium, especially telematic ones. The CLIENT/USER must not under any circumstance sign any admission of guilt. In case of the accident not being duly communicated or its report not being promptly sent, the CLIENT shall be obliged to pay a surcharge as specified in the surcharge table attached to these general terms and conditions, without this meaning that this will make him or her exempt from paying the cost of any damages (to both him/herself or any third parties) that might have taken place and that the insurance company might not cover (responsibility, of course that might be passed on by the CLIENT to the USER should it have been the USER who was driving at the time of the accident).

4. In case of theft of the vehicle : The CLIENT/USER is obliged to communicate the event to BLUEMOVE through the assistance hotline and to report the events to the Police within a maximum of twenty four (24) hours, starting from the moment when he/she realizes it, even in the case that the vehicle is later found. Independently of this, the CLIENT/USER shall send BLUEMOVE within seven (7) days, a copy of the Police report. In the event that noncompliance with this obligation resulted in the insurance company withdrawing its cover, the CLIENT (or the USER dependent on the CLIENT) will have to answer exclusively and personally for any damage that might have been caused to BLUEMOVE or any third parties.

#### Twelfth.- Price rates.-

Together with the document signed by the CLIENT in which the specific conditions which refer him or her to BLUEMOVE's website where the published price rates are contained (including the price rates of his or her agreement with BLUEMOVE), the CLIENT hereby receives the general terms and conditions he or she is subject to and according to he or she will be billed for the carsharing services provided by BLUEMOVE to the CLIENT, or where applicable, the USERS authorized by the CLIENT. These general terms and conditions are available for the CLIENT to consult at any time on BLUEMOVE's website (bluemove.es/es/condiciones-generales) and are considered to have been made known to the CLIENT by his agreement to them (by clicking on the corresponding button) during the registration process with BLUEMOVE. Additionally, if the client has registered online, or in BLUEMOVES high street office by filling out the digital form, he or she will not have a physical document containing the specific conditions and these therefore make reference to the conditions included within the rates section of BLUEMOVE's website (bluemove.es/es/precios-para-particulares).

These specific conditions, amongst other things, indicate the following: initially, the CLIENT will be using Blue Welcome tariff for 6 months which is the same as Blue Monthly tariff (with a 100% discount of monthly fee) according to the rates published on BLUEMOVE's website (bluemobe.es/es/precios-para-particulares). During these 6 months the CLIENT shall be charged the rate of 2 euros per hour + 0.25 euro per kilometer for any use of the "Economy" class vehicles (vehicle classes and their locations can be found on BLUEMOVE's website :bluemove.es/es/coches). After these 6 months, the CLIENT will be automatically me moved to the BLUE MONTHLY rate (with a monthly fee of 5 euros, as specified in BLUEMOVE's website - bluemove.es/es/precios/precios-para-particulares) unless he or she makes it known to BLUEMOVE by writing an email to management at buenosdias@bluemove.es that he or she does not wish this to be the case. If the CLIENT deems it appropriate, BLUEMOVE may provide him or her with advice on what rate is best suited to his or her needs based on the data about his or her use of the service collected over the year. The price rate may be modified by BLUEMOVE at any time, be it in order to adapt it to the annual variations of national inflation or, with lower or different regularity to adapt it to fuel price fluctuations or those of insurance policies taken out by BLUEMOVE for all of its vehicles (or those affecting any of its providers or relating to tax authorities). The CLIENT shall be notified about any change to the price rate in writing (referring the CLIENT to the price rates published on the website) by means of an email or, where appropriate by certified post, with this price rate change not having a retroactive effect upon any bookings already made or used before receiving notice of the change. In the event that the CLIENT wishes to change his or her rate, this may be done at any time over the phone but with a 31 day '(minimum) notice being given to BLUEMOVE before the beginning of the month affected by the change in rate (the rate may only be changed at the beginning of a natural month. In no case shall BLUEMOVE reimburse any amount related to a past rate (neither partial nor total) in order to adjust it and bring it in line with a new rate.

#### Thirteenth.- Billing and payment of submitted invoices.-

The bills for the services provided, including any surcharges as specified and foreseen in the surcharge table attached to these general terms and conditions which the CLIENT and/or USER has agreed to, shall be issued by BLUEMOVE for every use of the service during the days immediately following it. The charge to the CLIENT's or USER's credit or debit card will be made automatically at the end of the service offered by BLUEMOVE. Nevertheless, when formalising any booking, double of the amount due according to the CLIENT's rate shall be automatically blocked on the CLIENT's or USER's credit or debit card. The same procedure shall be applied to any modifications to the booking during its validity. Under exceptional circumstances previously acknowledged and agreed to by BLUEMOVE, at its own discretion and under its own terms, invoices shall be created on a monthly basis at the end of the month. In such a case, they will be sent to the CLIENT via email and will be due to be paid for in full within ten days after their issue date, and debited from the bank account specified by the CLIENT or where applicable, the credit or debit card associated to said account; in any case contemplated by the specific sections of the agreement. There exist however, four exceptions to the previously outlined billing policy:

1. In those cases where direct debit is in place, and except for exceptional cases as determined by BLUEMOVE at its own discretion, if you have accumulated more than 150€ worth of expenses before the end of a calendar month, you will have to pay the total amount in full before being able to once again use the service.

2. For those cases where direct debit is in place, except for exceptional cases determined by BLUEMOVE at its own discretion, if you are going to be making use of the service for more three or more days, you will have to pay in full for the whole time period before being able to use the vehicle.

3. For those cases where direct debit is in place, except for exceptional cases determined by BLUEMOVE at its own discretion, BLUEMOVE will be able to demand pre-payment in full from the CLIENT or a deposit based on the expected monthly spending, decided at BLUEMOVE's discretion. In such an event, the bank account details given by the CLIENT or the USER to BLUEMOVE may not be modified without the previous approval by BLUEMOVE. The non payment by the CLIENT of any standing invoice shall result in the immediate suspension of the right to make new bookings and the cancellation of any bookings made up to that point, both by the CLIENT and by any USER authorized by the CLIENT, even those in the future, until the CLIENT pays any outstanding debts to BLUEMOVE. The non payment of any invoice will be met with a surcharge to compensate for the costs of administering the action taken by BLUEMOVE, which will be added to the very next bill to the CLIENT after the last one when the debt has been paid. In the event that any outstanding debt is not paid to BLUEMOVE within a month, BLUEMOVE shall produce an invoice for the costs derived from it during the next calendar month or within the next 12 months, including in it any legal costs that might be derived from it up to a maximum amount of 400 euro. The continued non payment of invoices, with at least two successive or alternating invoices not being paid, shall be sufficient grounds to terminate the contract, from the moment in which BLUEMOVE notifies the CLIENT of this in writing (through an email or ordinary mail). Any complaints about the amount billed in any invoice, must be made to BLUEMOVE by the CLIENT within a maximum of fifteen (15) days, starting from the date the invoice was issued, and in writing (via email or ordinary mail). After this due date, the invoice will be deemed to have been accepted as correct by the CLIENT. Any modification to an invoice that is accepted by BLUEMOVE shall be added to the following voice issued by BLUEMOVE to the CLIENT.

#### Fourteenth.-Special surcharges.-

BLUEMOVE will add to every invoice any special surcharges that might be applicable, when any of the events that legitimize them, as specified in the table attached to these general terms and conditions along with the corresponding amounts charged for each in Euro. This attached table is an indicative but not necessarily complete list of the incidents that might take place during the booking time of one of our vehicles, but it cannot foresee all possible events that might derive in additional costs that the CLIENT might have to cover, according to the current general terms and conditions of the agreement.

#### Fifteenth.- Data protection for the CLIENT/USER and any third parties.-

All personal data belonging to the CLIENT or to any USER authorized by the CLIENT and any belonging to any third party related to the use and driving of any of the vehicles owned by BLUEMOVE will be stored and managed in a database managed and administered under the sole responsibility of BLUEMOVE, personified in Mónica Gheorghe with an exclusive email address only to be used for issues related to this which is monica@bluemove.es.

If the CLIENT wishes his personal information to be handled with the purpose outlined in the previous section 2, he or she will have to make it explicitly known in the personal conditions of his or her agreement by filling out the corresponding section, always making sure his or her signature appears next to it (independently of the final signature). The CLIENT, like the USERS designated by the CLIENT will be able to exercise their right to access, correct, modify, and cancel the presence of their personal information by making their wishes known, in writing, to the person responsible for their data and the maintenance of our database as outlined at the beginning of this section and via the email address indicated. The CLIENT accepts that from a data protection perspective his or her data may be shared among the companies affiliated to BLUEMOVE or the provider of carsharing software services used by it (due to purely technical operational reasons related to the nature of the service). Likewise, his or her contractual bond with the company or any of its affiliates is legally valid with any of the companies belonging to the group. Special note to the vehicles localization system.- Every vehicle belonging to BLUEMOVE is equipped with a GPS system that allows it to be located, for obvious reasons given its activity. When using the GPS system in order to locate its vehicles, BLUEMOVE will strive to respect the privacy of its CLIENTS/USERS, in such a way that this process shall only be used then a delay occurs in the return of a vehicle and in case of theft of a vehicle. Only in the event of theft of the vehicle, will BLUEMOVE share the information provided by the GPS system with the local Security Forces and any other administrative or legal authorities or private companies that might require such information in order to be able to retrieve the stolen vehicle.

#### Sixteenth.- Duration, suspension and other events leading to the termination of the agreement.-

1. Without these affecting the causes of termination or suspension of the agreement due to breaches of it by the CLIENT, as laid out in the thirteenth section of the general terms and in any specific conditions, agreement entered into by the CLIENT and BLUEMOVE is of indefinite duration. The CLIENT may terminate it at any time he or she wishes to, by communicating it in writing, through ordinary mail or email, or personally in BLUEMOVE's premises. The termination of contract made by the CLIENT in this manner does not in any case release him or her from the obligation to pay any outstanding invoices already issued by BLUEMOVE or any others in the process of being issued for services already provided by the company to the CLIENT or USERS before the time of contract termination.

2. Additionally, BLUEMOVE may suspend or terminate the contract at any time, without prior warning given to the CLIENT if he or she, or any USERS authorized by him or her, were to repeatedly be found to be in breach of their contractual obligations as USERS, unrelated to payments, or should there be an elevated number of accidents involving the vehicles used in their bookings. In these cases, just like in any others where the contract might be terminated by BLUEMOVE, the personal cards belonging to the CLIENT and the USERS authorized by the CLIENT would be immediately blocked by BLUEMOVE except for in the case where a booked vehicle was currently in use in which case BLUEMOVE would block the cards as soon as the booking ended.

3, In any event of contract termination by the CLIENT or by BLUEMOVE, BLUEMOVE shall have thirty (30) days to reimburse the deposit made by the CLIENT when entering into the agreement, after any amount owed to BLUEMOVE by the CLIENT is deducted from it.

#### Seventeenth.-Complaints and claims.-

The CLIENT and where applicable any authorized USER, may make a formal complaint about any aspect of the carsharing services provided by BLUEMOVE in writing by sending an email to buenosdias@bluemove.es ; BLUEMOVES customer service email address.

#### Eighteenth.- Contract, partial invalidity and applicable law and jurisdiction.-

1. The contract is made up of the previous general terms and conditions, the special conditions adhered to by the CLIENT, including pricing and the attached table of surcharges that the client will have received when entering into the agreement, any pricing changes which the CLIENT is notified of during the contracts term, and, any forms through which the CLIENT designates users as authorized by him or her.

2. These general terms and conditions may be updated by Blue Sostenible S.L. or by any of its affiliate companies at any time in the future as long as this does not imply a reduction of or harm to the client's rights as a consequence.

3. If any section of the general or specific terms and conditions were to be declared juridically void, that would have no effect upon the rest of terms and conditions.

4. Any disagreement that might arise between the CLIENT or USER and BLUEMOVE, where an interpretation or compliance of any of the sections of this agreement is concerned, both parties agree to the arbitration by the Spanish Justice system.
